## Reflect on your journey
Don't forget where you started and be proud of how far you've come. Remind yourself that **you are a developer**, no qualm nor question. You can write programs, you know multiple programming languages. You can read documentation, and you've worked in a team building full-stack web applications.

## Focus on self-improvement
Comparison with others are almost always not fair. For example, senior developers don't know everything, they often just know how to get to an answer faster; they have learned how to learn, done more and failed more

Find a mentor, talk to others about your feelings and experience, connect and be open to your LHL cohort-mates, instructors (and later on, your co-workers, lead developer, and engineering manager at your job); don't be afraid to admit what you don't know, as you're very likely not alone.

Learning is a lifelong process:
  - Learning compounds over time: the more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the better the opportunity
  - Learning lessens the effects of impostor syndrome: you know what's coming and take the first wins with a pinch of salt, and so the drop will be less painful or even not noticeable
  - Learning takes time and practice. Be patient, adaptable, curious, and tenacious
